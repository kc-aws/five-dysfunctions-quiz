# Team Dynamics Assessment

This web-based tool provides a comprehensive assessment of team dynamics based on Patrick Lencioni's "Five Dysfunctions of a Team" framework. It helps teams identify strengths and opportunities for improvement across five critical dimensions of team effectiveness.

## Overview

The Five Dysfunctions of a Team framework identifies common challenges that prevent teams from achieving their full potential:

1. **Absence of Trust** - Teams that lack trust are unwilling to be vulnerable and open with each other
2. **Fear of Conflict** - Without trust, teams cannot engage in unfiltered, passionate debate
3. **Lack of Commitment** - Without healthy conflict, team members rarely commit to decisions
4. **Avoidance of Accountability** - Without commitment, teams tend to avoid holding each other accountable
5. **Inattention to Results** - When team members aren't held accountable, they put their individual needs above team results

This assessment tool helps measure your team's current standing on each of these dimensions, providing valuable insights and targeted recommendations for improvement.

## How the Assessment Works

### Individual Assessment

The assessment consists of 30 questions (6 per dimension) rated on a 5-point scale:
- 1: Rarely
- 2: Occasionally
- 3: Sometimes
- 4: Usually
- 5: Almost Always

Questions are designed to measure behaviors and attitudes that indicate team health in each dimension. Higher scores indicate stronger performance in that area.

### Results Interpretation

After completing the assessment, you'll receive:

1. **Dimension Scores**: Percentage scores (0-100%) for each of the five dimensions
2. **Visual Representation**: Progress bars and a radar chart showing your team's profile
3. **Targeted Recommendations**: Specific suggestions based on your scores in each dimension
4. **Export Code**: A normalized score (on a 0-10 scale) that can be shared with team leaders

### Team Aggregate Results

The tool can also aggregate results from multiple team members to provide a comprehensive team view, showing average scores across all dimensions.

## Instructions for Individual Users

1. **Taking the Assessment**:
   - Answer all 30 questions honestly based on your current team experience
   - Rate each statement from 1 (Rarely) to 5 (Almost Always)
   - Click "Calculate Results" when finished

2. **Understanding Your Results**:
   - Review your scores in each dimension (higher is better)
   - Pay special attention to your lowest-scoring areas
   - Read the recommendations for improvement
   - The radar chart provides a visual representation of your team profile

3. **Sharing Your Results**:
   - Find your export code at the bottom of the results page
   - Copy this code (a string of 5 numbers separated by commas)
   - Share this code with your team leader when requested
   - You can also print your results for personal reference

## Instructions for Team Leaders

1. **Preparing for Team Assessment**:
   - Share the assessment link with all team members
   - Ask everyone to complete it individually and honestly
   - Request that each team member copy their export code and send it to you

2. **Aggregating Team Results**:
   - Click "Import Team Results" on the main page
   - Paste each team member's export code on a separate line in the text box
   - Click "Process Team Results" to generate team averages

3. **Analyzing Team Results**:
   - The radar chart highlights team strengths and weaknesses at a glance
   - Focus improvement efforts on the dimensions with the lowest scores
   - Use the provided recommendations as discussion starters
   - Consider running facilitated sessions to address identified challenges

4. **Tracking Progress**:
   - Re-assess the team periodically (e.g., quarterly) to measure improvement
   - Compare results over time to track progress
   - Celebrate improvements and continue working on challenge areas

## Best Practices for Using the Assessment

1. **Create Psychological Safety**: Ensure team members feel safe to answer honestly
2. **Emphasize Development**: Position this as a development tool, not a performance evaluation
3. **Contextualize Scores**: Recognize that all teams have room for improvement
4. **Take Action**: Commit to addressing at least one key area identified by the assessment
5. **Reassess Regularly**: Team dynamics change over time; plan for periodic reassessment
